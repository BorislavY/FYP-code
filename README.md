# FYP-code

The code used for completing the BSc (Hons) Sound Engineering and Production final year project titled "Processing of individual audio tracks as a content-based transformation using deep neural networks".

This repository does not contain the code progression or alternative approaches that were tested along the way.

The Python folder containts data pre-processing, evaluation, prediction and visualization scripts. FYP-code/Python/Models/Initial/ are models trained initialy for a smaller number of epochs. FYP-code/Python/Models/Final/ are models trained for longer and are the ones used for evaluation.
Scripts such as Visualize.py and Evaluate.py contain just one example. They do not contain the code used for the visualization or evaluation of evey single model.

The MATLAB folder contains short scripts for extracting different features from audio files, used to analyse the performance of the trained models.
