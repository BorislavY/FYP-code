# FYP-code
The final code used for completing the FYP.

This repository does not contain the code progression or alternative approaches that were tested along the way.

Most of the files do not include comments, as their main purpose is to prove that work was done, not explain how the code works.

Scripts such as Visualize.py and Evaluate.py contain just one example. They do not contain the code used for the visualization or evaluation of evey single model.
